Yï»¿arn bombing, or guerilla knitting, is fascinating. It is considered a type of street art, and involves covering something in public with a knitted/crocheted piece. It could be small, like a garland on a fence, or massive, like covering an entire bus. As with other pieces of street art, it can be 'frivolous' and colourful or a message/allegory. Whatever form it takes, it is the crafters' answer to graffiti and should not be overlooked.
