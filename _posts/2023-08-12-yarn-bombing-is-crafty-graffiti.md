Y﻿arn bombing, or guerilla knitting, is fascinating. It is considered a type of street art, and involves covering something in public with a knitted/crocheted piece. It could be small, like a garland on a fence, or massive, like covering an entire bus. As with other pieces of street art, it can be 'frivolous' and colourful or a message/allegory. Whatever form it takes, it is the crafters' answer to graffiti and should not be overlooked.

M﻿agda Sayeg is credited with having begun the current style of yarn bombing when, in 2005, she began covering her shop handles in knitted scraps. This caught on, and Sayeg has since moved on to [far larger projects](https://www.ted.com/talks/magda_sayeg_how_yarn_bombing_grew_into_a_worldwide_movement) and schemes. These have inspired multiple people to take this style and adapt it to their own causes. Tree scarves, accessories and coverings for statues, post box toppers, even garments with political or social messages placed for others to wear and pass on.  There are hundreds of instances of yarn bombing, with the UK lockdowns and royal celebrations provoking many to experiment in this medium. The internet and social media provide a plethora of images displaying the creativity in bright colours and eye-catching items.

B﻿ut these items are as prone to vandalism as any other street art. Some have been removed by council authorities and litter pickers due to their unauthorised nature. Others have been removed or had pieces taken by members of the public.
