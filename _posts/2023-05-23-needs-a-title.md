Libraries are not new or mysterious, yet they have so much potential that is underutilised and underfunded. People are aware they exist and rent things, and many have computers, but otherwise they are just another public service only thought of as a vague one-use place. But they have numerous fabulous ways to help and provide for communities. 

Fï»¿irst are the basics- borrowing. People borrow media from the library, including books, audiobooks, dvds and cds, and magazines. But many people are unaware of the online resources that libraries make available. Largescale digital media companies like Overdrive and Borrowbox have huge databases built for libraries to offer to patrons to explore and utilise. All the variety of a physical library, without the issues presented by getting to the physical library. (These features were very useful during the pandemic lockdowns, where books were quarantined between loans and browsing was significantly more awkward.) Services such as these provide ebooks, audiobooks, magazine subscriptions, and even certain video media resources for documentaries, films and television series. All accessible with a simple login using a library card.
