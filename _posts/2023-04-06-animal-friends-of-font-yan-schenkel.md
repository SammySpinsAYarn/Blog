T﻿he first book of Yan Schenkel's work released in English, *Animal Friends of Pica Pau*, was published in 2017 by Meteor Books. The "20 colourful amigurumi characters" featured in the patterns captured the eye of many crocheters, with over 2200 recreations listed on Ravelry and over 1000 five star reviews on Amazon. The cover contrasts a muted wooden background against the lively features of Victor Frog, Hector Rhinoceros, Audrey Gazelle, and René Yacaré Caiman. Top-and-tailing these are four different fonts in bold white.
