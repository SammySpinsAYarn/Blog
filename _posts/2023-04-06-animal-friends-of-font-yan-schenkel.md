T﻿he first book of Yan Schenkel's work released in English, *Animal Friends of Pica Pau*, was published in 2017 by Meteoor Books. The "20 colourful amigurumi characters" featured in the patterns captured the eye of mmany crocheters, with over 2200 recreations listed on Ravelry and over 1000 five star reviews on Amazon. While the works are friends of Pica Pau, are they friends of crocheters and bookshelves?

F﻿irst of all, who is this Pica Pau and why do they have so many friends? Well, Schenkel has a yarn brand named after the woodpecker species Pica Pau. The typeface used is that of the yarn labels, pairing the material to the creations. The sans-serif handwritten style alternates capital and lowercase letters and has all counters filled  in a way that gives a more rounded appearance.

The cover contrasts a muted wooden background against the lively features of Victor Frog, Hector Rhinoceros, Audrey Gazelle, and René Yacaré Caiman. Top-and-tailing these are four different fonts in bold white.
