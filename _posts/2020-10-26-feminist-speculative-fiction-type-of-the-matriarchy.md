What do these three novels have in common? All three were written by female authors. All three have been on award shortlists. All three are dystopian novels focusing on a dramatically different to our society, thanks to a skew in the scales of gender power. Yet the plots are incredibly different, the authors of different ages and intents. So why are the three so reminiscent of one another?

![](../uploads/article5-header.jpg)

The three are have "similar" paratextual elements in some regards. In these editions, all have a bold and vivid red colour prominent on them, with black and white playing lesser accompanying roles. All focus on the title as a, or even *the*, major element of the cover's layout. This could have two reasons. The first is that for each of these books, the title is the focus of the plot. Atwood's *The Handmaid's Tale* is, according to the "epilogue", the transcription of the recorded musings of an escaped Handmaid from Gilead, an extreme and violent patriarchy. Alderman's *The Power* questions what would happen if women suddenly gained a physical advantage over men, and how would this change society? And *Vox* by Daschler follows the story of a woman in a country where women are silenced by law. All three have titles that encapsulate the focus of the book.

Another comparative point is the bold typeface the three covers feature their titles are printed in. Stereotypically, female narrated novels are considered more 'floofy' and feature calligraphic cursive scripts for their titles (possibly because many of those prominently feature romance, which expects something softer). Yet these books are bold, blunt capitalised titles that are almost-stamp-like in their nature- not a style typically associated with the feminine. Sans-serif declarations that demand attention in the way the women of these stories often cannot (*Power* featuring a number of exceptions as the story progresses). This blunt manner also emulated fonts used by propaganda and government writings, and emulated by a number of dystopias, giving it an authority lacking in the presentation of women in many works of literature. It also represents the way these women are facing the realities of their settings- Offred escapes her reality through fleeing into memories but does not deny what happens around her in Gilead; the assaults the characters in *The Power* are recognised for how they affect these characters rather than the protagonists shying away from them; Jean recognises the signs of what was happening at the rise of the 'Pure', but ignores them, and reminisces on this as she watches her daughter be forced into silence.

A final commonality is the size discrepancy in the words themselves. The TV adaptation edition of Atwood's novel lacks its accolades and awards, and has all details but the title in a smaller, more slender size, including the author's name. Everything not wholly of the novel has been sidelined to focus on *The Handmaid's Tale*. Unlike with Atwood, Alderman has more ornamentation on her cover, with the lightning bolts of power and prominent female figure prominently featured.  This book also has reviews where the previous did not- likely as Alderman is less renowned. Yet as with the first example, all information but the title (author, reviews, logo) are minimised in size and line density, as though attempting to leave the majority of the attention with *The Power* of the title. Finally is *Vox.* More text-heavy than its compatriots, either because of its message of using words to enact change or because this was Daschler's debut so needed the draw or others recognising her quality. Between all three books however are the similarities of large, prominent bold titles with all other information in a thinner, smaller, but still entirely capitalised typeface. They ensure their focus is clear, visible and central through the fonts used for their text.

Despite all the similarities and differences of the cover, the fact remains that these are three distinct stories whose main link is their genre, which is part of likely why they resemble one another so much. But their typefaces are a major part of their message, marketing and presentation.
