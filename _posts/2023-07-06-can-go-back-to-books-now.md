W﻿attpad. FanFiction.net. AO3. These are major publishing platforms for Joe Anybody to share their work with an audience without gatekeeping or fees. They are founts of the bizarre and wonderful, and build communities and authors. Sometimes they are also a place for writers to gain income from this work, be it on the platform or by moving on from it with an established audience. More often though they are passion projects meant to simply make a work accessible to the masses.

Open access digital stories can hugely vary in quality. They range from the infamous, like the *My Immortal* fanfic, to the hugely successful, such as *The Martian*. Anybody with internet access can write on platforms ranging from those designed for a single author's work, to library-style collections, to blogs and social media posts. This is the nature of media online. This disparity means there are those who will not read books that are not traditionally published. They rely on the quality control provided by publishing houses.  Not a bad idea. Publishing houses need to ensure their products meet their criteria, so there is a self-determined standard they hold their stories to. This is part of the service readers pay for in buying that book. But that does not mean stories that have not gone through this process all lack merit. There are many online by people who have honed their writing skills and produce quality stories. After all, some books are picked up from digital platforms to be traditionally published. They are recognised for their quality not just by their enthusiastic fans, but by companies who stake income and reputation on the stories accepted and books they produced.

Y﻿et the lack of censorship means the stories are *allowed* to be different. They can rely on tropes of be completely alien. Lean into pop culture or entirely ignore it. Be six word stories or tomes of over a thousand pages. There is a reason instagram poetry is recognised as a different style to conventional poetry. Online creators have the freedom to cultivate an audience and style independent to their geographic restrictions (subject to laws though, for better or worse). Their reach is both greater and more limited as they grow an audience. Digital works also allow embedded media- video clips, gifs, music- so readers can engage in a way physical books often struggle to facilitate. This adds to their alternative style, leaning in to the medium. By existing in an intangible, non-fixed form, there is greater room for experimentative explorative writing in online ether. Plus, many of these platforms allow comments and contact so audiences can provide feedback and develop a more collaborative story or closer author-reader relations. Minimal gatekeeping means online stories can be more unorthodox.

Unpublished stories also represent something important. Artistic effort. Not every story will be published by professionals (and we should all be grateful for this). But that does note mean that the effort put into producing those works is worthless. They show dedication. An attempt at expression. And a level of planning. Unpublished stories are either labours of love produced for the writer or a means of skillbuilding for future projects- or both. Financially worth less does not mean worthless. Regarding them as such fails to recognise the audience numbers they can accrue, or the storylines involved. It discredits millions of works that deserve a better name than simply 'not good enough for a publishing house'.

W﻿hether widely available online or a private account shared with few intimates, online works of writing can be just as valid as their printed counterparts. They can be incredible or cringeworthy. Uniquely original or cliche-ridden. Epically long or under five chapters But they are all expressions of a writer and an effort to share their thoughts with an audience. Reminders that creative people exist at all levels of skill and often desire to share that with those interested.
