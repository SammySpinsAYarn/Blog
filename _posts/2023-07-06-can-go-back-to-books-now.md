Wï»¿attpad. FanFiction.net. AO3. These are major publishing platforms for Joe Anybody to share their work with an audience without gatekeeping or fees. They are founts of the bizarre and wonderful, and build communities and authors. Sometimes they are also a place for writers to gain income from this work, be it on the platform or by moving on from it with an established audience. More often though they are passion projects meant to simply make a work accessible to the masses.

Open access digital stories can hugely vary in quality. They range from the infamous like *My Immortal* fanfic to the hugely successful, like *The Martian.*
