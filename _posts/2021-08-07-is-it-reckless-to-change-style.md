Cornelia Funke left the world of *Inkheart* and dreamt up Jacob Reckless' *MirrorWorld*. This land borders our own through windows, such as the mirror Jacob Reckless finds in his late father's study. It leads to a world of fairytales- but all are far more Grimm than Disney. Goyls (a derivation of the gargoyle?), Bluebeards, kelpies, murderous unicorns, faeries (of old, with morals and punishments all their own), curses, enchantments, bespelled items and hexed trinkets. All this only a mirror away- provided you are brave- or reckless- enough to go through. Yet six years after its release, the *Reckless* series became the MirrorWorld, and its style underwent as much of a change as Jacob's reputation does when crossing worlds. How did this rebrand impact the covers? And, as the fourth novel peers through from November, is it still a reflection of the book?

Upon its release in 2010, Funke had two separate hardbacks released. One with Little Brown, featuring the Goyl-jade skin of Will, gazing back at the viewer from the mirror through which the curse resides; the other, from Chicken House, fixes golden-amber eyes upon the reader from the glimmer of marble-like skin, the expression seemingly that of prey both angered and panicked. Then yet another cover was created for the 2013 paperback editions following the release of its sequel *Fearless*. So with two books and an assortment of covers to choose from, what happened? Why the about-face to this?

According to *The Bookseller*, Funke moved from Chicken House (and US counterpoint Little Brown) to Pushkin Press based on editorial disputes regarding the third novel. As a result, the novel was transferred to new teams with new ideas, inspirations and tastes. These new covers and titles are likely a result. The Pushkin team redesigned the books of Lionel Wigram's translations of Funke's work into English in order to stamp their own mark on them in preparation for the continuation of the series and create a fresh start with Funke and her works. It may also have been necessary if the cover designers or the original team were less willing to share and pass-over their works.

So, with an idea of the why this reshaping of the paratext occurred, it is the time to consider if this was a good decision and how it has shaped impressions of the book.

When placed side-by-side, the differences are apparent. The colour palette and illustrations are completely distinct, and the typography of the title is disparate. Yet despite this, there are also certain elements that go unchanged. Although the colouring of the lettering changes, the typeface itself is consistent for Funke's name. This is likely to match the typeface used for her name on her other novels to have some form of consistency across her works; editions of numerous titles, including *Inkheart*, *Dragon Rider* and *Igraine The Brave* all featured this particular font. The consistency is part of the presentation of Funke as an author, so remains similar, if not identical, across multiple aspects of her portfolio. 

Comparing the titles, one difference is startlingly evident. The names are dramatically altered. *Reckless* goes from an embossed scrawl, as if from a messy writer with a quill, to delicately serifed, all-caps monospace for *The Petrified Flesh*. It could be argued that this change is to suit the new title and pair with the blend of delicacy and brutality of the thorn butterfly (or, more likely, a moth as the Fairy uses in the book). This also suits the disparity of the title, with flesh becoming stone as Will's does, and as human becomes Goyl. With this in mind, the changing of the font for Reckless to pair with that of the title and author's name makes more sense. Again, it is about cohesion in the style and presentation. The bold, all-caps, staggered sizing of Reckless is attention grabbing, albeit in a different manner to that of the original. It is not ostentatious but it refuses to fade into the background. The contrast in sizing between title and series name is similar to that between the brothers bearing that name. Jacob is confrontational and, as the surname suggests, rather reckless; Will is unassuming in his manner and presentation, and despite his gradual metamorphosis, he remains overlooked in the book in favour of the subdued flamboyance of Jacob's adventuring attitude. It also keeps the focus centred on the series, the world and its protagonist rather than on the individual story of its first book.

Design team Jing Zheng and Mathew Cullen also dramatically altered the purely aesthetic aspects. The only aspect maintained were silver adornments, but even they have been transformed in purpose. The human centric imagery has been replaced by an image outlined or styled by something unrelated: a moth made of a rosebush, a swirl of wind drawing a fox's face, a face silhouetted by a tree. While the illustrative elements remain focused in the foreground, they are entirely unlike the previous editions. Impressions of characters and artefacts of characters replace clear portraits and silhouettes. Fitting for a series set where nothing is entirely one thing, or forthright in identity and intention. Finally the colours change from the icy white of a marble Goyl, to the strong spectrum of one colour per cover embellished in silver. Here, richer colours fade to pastels to blankness to be painted over in stronger shades to give the imagery. Nothing in the pictures remains the same across, with nature being twisted into these fantastical illustrations rather than a single being confronting a danger. Perhaps this is to comply with the revisions and updates cited on the back cover of *The Petrified Flesh*. Pushkin is bringing in more of the fairy tale elements and mysteries of the MirrorWorld to the more mundane, or occasionally repetitive, nature of fantasy covers.

Combining the changes of type, colour, imagery, and even text, the pairing of Pushkin and Funke have completely left the path laid by Chicken House's work. But was this a wise decision? Or was the reimaging of the series too divergent from what had been established?

Personally, I prefer the Pushkin series covers to that of the Chicken House paperbacks, but prefer the original white hardback to the latest reprints. The mystical elements and colouring better matches the plots of the novels and the winding nature of the stories, rather than the "one man against a grave danger" the paperbacks allude to. Reckless is not without allies, nor is he as certain as the silhouettes make him out to be. The depiction of Will on the Chicken House captures his transformation, the catalyst for the novel, exceptionally well while appealing to readers. Balancing all of these out, from one perspective, the Pushkin rebrand was a success aesthetically. It also allows the consistency in depiction of the series as new books are released (such as *The Golden Yarn* and its Russian inspirations and *The Silver Tracks* Asian (possibly Japanese, based on the kitsune) leanings in mythology).

Viewing it from an impartial outlook, Pushkin's rebranding of the series was for the best. To remain the same would have created confusion during the transition that may have impacted later works as well as complicating Funke's portfolio and divorce from Chicken House regarding her series. Though the style change did not have to be as drastic as the route taken, that was likely considered by the team who decided on the style of the covers based on data about the series, their own connections, and the UK market for Funke's books.

Therefore, it was ultimately for the best that the *Reckless* series underwent a transformation when changing publishing house. This path was best for this particular series and its circumstances. However, in other cases, the decision to change the books in this manner may well be erroneous.
