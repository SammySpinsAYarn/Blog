The first ebook's creation is contested, but whether it was created with Project Gutenberg in the 70s, or came about in the [90s on a floppy disk](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/12/ebooks-begin-medium-reading-peter-james). Regardless of the format's origins, it is undeniable that digital editions of books are incredibly popular and widely accessible. Despite their many benefits, and the many fear-mongering commentaries at the time, ebooks will never replace physical books. This is a good thing, and does nothing to diminish the value of the format itself.
