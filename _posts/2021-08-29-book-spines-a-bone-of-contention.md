Having recently been exploring bookstagram and BookTube (and tentatively peeking at BookTok), curious searches have uncovered numerous shelfies. Looking at the curated bookcases with their arrangements, carefully ordered stacks, and chosen trinkets, a thought occurred. Why are spines not used more? There are many breath-taking and unique spines in the world, but there are also mundane or under-valued ones. The dichotomy is both irrefutable and unfathomable.

Much digital ink has been spilt on the virtues of cover design. Yet so often, when shopping in person, the first part of a book seen is the spine. So why is it not being used more often as a way to draw attention to the book? Cover design is a major part of both the production and marketing processes of a book. It shows major aspects of the book, such as genre, key aspects, themes and characters, and even plot details in some cases. Yet, while the covers are often gazed at with longing and transferred to marketing and promotional materials, such as postcards, bookmarks and posters. Why is this not the case with book spines?

Chipp Kid's TED talk *[The hilarious art of book design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC0KxNeLp1E)* features covers ranging from the iconic to the intriguing. Most of the examples he features include images of their spines, but only two are discussed. The Osuma Tezuka series, where the spines together create an overlaying image across all; the other being *My Name Is Red*, where the spine creates part of the narrative of the cover being pulled from the shelf. Even among these unique points of pride, these career accomplishments, the spines are not considered features, but side-effects. Even to a book designer, the spine is not worth noting unless it represents an addition to the story of the front cover. Why is this the case, and how do we change it?

The first reason they may be overlooked: size limitations. While book covers typically have similar sizes, the spine varies dramatically. For the thinner books, function must come first. Spines must show the key information- this is the first priority, for differentiation from others on the shelf. The World Book Day Â£1 books are excellent examples of this. While they often feature some decorative or illustrative elements, it is the author and title that come first. Larger books will have additional space on the spine, either in height or breadth, and therefore have a greater chance to be utilised by the designers. Thus some may view spines as irrelevant due to reduced surface area available to play with.

A second reason may be digitisation. As ebooks gain more and more prevalence, and online retailers typically show only the cover on the listing for the title, effort spent curating an aesthetic and intriguing spine may be considered wasted as it is not visible to a large percentile of shoppers. By assigning the spine the label of informative, like the blurb, rather than something decorative, like the majority of covers, it means less is lost to the rising tide of digital sales. If a lesser degree of effort is placed into this, it will not be erased in the online marketplace. Therefore the spine may be relegated as an auxiliary feature instead of an opportunity for expression.

Thirdly comes the opportunity for further editions. One incredible feature some special editions have are the special, decorative spines adorning them. Many popular novels will have reprints with new and intricate spines featuring fabulous and inviting images. An example is the soon-to-be-released reprint of the first three novels in Novik's *Temeraire* series which will feature art of the eponymous dragon. Not releasing first editions with these detailed spines means publishers can use this on later copies when the audience for the series has grown. This allows for a unique element on later editions to encourage purchase among both existing fans with older editions and new audiences interested in the series. So it is the sale opportunity for new sales that may prevent.

Finally, a fourth possibility is simply series sales. A debut author will likely not be publishing a large series requiring cohesive designs as their first publication. They are unlikely to be releasing an extensive grand saga that could benefit from grand, matching, iconic spines- not right away. So long as a new book with no pre-existing audience has a clear and attractive cover with a legible spine that pairs with the covers, the box is checked. It takes additional planning to create an extravagant cover. And as the series develops, so will the style of the covers to continue to match the books as they are released. Later editions are better suited to matching covers, as discussed in the point above. So attempting ornate and lavish covers for a first-time author may be a wasted effort if they do not have the audience base to support their sales.

With these perfectly valid reasons, why are book spines still a frustration? There are many beautiful book spines. There are many matching or coordinated spines. There are even functional spines that still suit the purpose and have aesthetic appeal to them. Why are they still an irritation?

Simple. Inconsistency.

There are two forms of this inconsistency. Inconsistency with the cover and story; and inconsistency with others in the series.

Most books are seen spine-first when browsing in person. How many books are passed over because an incredible story has been saddled with a lackluster spine? How many have typefaces so stylised or chunky that the casual reader will skip over? Misleading cover art (the spine being part of the cover) is a misrepresentation of the book and therefore means readers may be dissatisfied or overlook the book.

And there are few things more frustrating than collecting a series with exceptional cover art, and then it being changed halfway through. Be it a change in illustrative or typographic choices, or even an entire overhaul (as *A Court of Thorns and Roses* is doing), the emotions evoked can range from irking to infuriating. Altering the design and creating a mismatch alters the impression of the series. The inconsistency divides the story as it rests on the shelf.

And how do we fix this issue? How do we ensure that all spines are viewed and admired the same as their cover counterparts? Simple. We demand it be so. [Ellie Violet Bramley](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/18/in-the-instagram-age-you-actually-can-judge-a-book-by-its-cover), [Paula Cocozza](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/27/how-ebooks-lost-their-shine-kindles-look-clunky-unhip-) and [Holly Connolly](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/28/is-social-media-influencing-book-cover-design) all wrote for *The Guardian* about how bookstagram and a resurgence in the love of physical books has prompted publishers to up their cover design for a number of their products because of the impact social media has made in sales and marketing. The Bookseller has been [publishing articles](https://www.thebookseller.com/search/site/BookTok?page=1) for a little over a year about the impact of BookTok on sales and backlists. As a for-profit industry, publishing had to adapt to match the needs and desires of their customers, and that meant improving this aspect of the product. By extending that attitude to the spine rather than just the front cover, readers and collectors can press the issue with those crafting the books. This will force their hand and the spines will receive the care and attention due to them as part of the book.

With all of this in mind, there is only one question to consider. Are the spines on the shelf truly representing the books (both for the story and in the marketing) or would they fade into the background of a shelfie?
