Books are written on all topics, so it should suprise no one that there are both fiction and non-fiction books out in the world about these artefacts and the people involed in their production. How-tos on their writing and production, analyses on their history and role in the world, to current books all about those whose lives centre the books. Here are a few of the latter variety that I want to read before the end of the year. 

[T﻿he Cat Who Saved Books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/19a53404-887d-4bde-b209-60fb17679d2c) by Sōsuke Natsukawa and [What You Are Looking For is in the Library](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2409ddb7-9114-42fd-86c4-39996c61befc) by Michiko Aoyama

B﻿oth of these books are translated Japanese fiction books centring bookish locations and a fantastical element. In the first a talking cat enlists a teenager, who has just taken over their recently deceased grandfather's bookshop, in their mission to save the unloved books of the world. It is apparently a hopeful and reflective novel, and at under 200 pages sounds like a whimsical weekend read. The latter follows a magical librarian who helps her patrons through book recommendations capable of altering their life's path, and she (presumably) gets a front row seat to this upon the book's return.
