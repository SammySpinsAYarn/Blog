Online book spaces often host people showing book hauls, unread books, and ever-growing to-be-read stacks. Hours of content exist of people sharing it, explaining it, justifying or bemoaning it. Phrases like ‘Buying books and reading books are different hobbies’ or ‘At least it isn’t drugs’ get bandied about in conspiratorially supportive ways. So is this shame valid or unnecessary self-consciousness?

Many people feel disappointment over their unread books due to the investment. The book has been bought and stored, whether digitally or physically; you've invested in it. At present, materialistic consumption and personal economics are constantly scrutinised, and not making the most of possessed resources often causes shame. People regret purchases but are often doomed to repeat this 'mistake', continuing to add to the pile until it forms an unread personal library.

B﻿ut is this a valid response?
