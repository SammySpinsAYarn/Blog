Yarn crafters are familiar with the stash effect. The unwitting accumulation and seemingly independent multiplication of craft supplies. How individual skeins seem manageable but gather into hoards and lurk, waiting to topple out of storage spaces and bury the unsuspecting. My stash is smaller than others I've heard about, but still feels large. Somehow, in my efforts to shrink it through use, I have gathered more. embarked on my own stashbusting journey.

I﻿t started out simply enough. I decided I wanted to fit my stash into the new project bag I'd bought, which seems a good size and has fancy storage to fit all the needles, hooks, and associated habadashery. Accompanying this is a big supermarket shopping bag and smaller ongoing project bag, also full. These three bags contain the stash, all six-and-a-half-kilograms or so. (Yes, compared to others, this isn't huge. Still too big for my tastes.) Motivated by YouTubers like [Retro Claude](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIpjXi4a4nTRZe41dSvAlAxCW1lyEKaUo) and [The Crimson Stitchery](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1VxpiMcBXBPGMdDoSi63QK5ZRTgISf-6) I embarked on my own stashbusting journey.

R﻿avelry became my accomplice. I weighed and uploaded all the skeins, cataloguing them for easy browsing and project updates. Armed, I scrolled through patterns. My queue grew to over twenty. I was prepared.

E﻿xcept, the yarns weren't quite right. I have four different yellows, but none were bright enough for the Pride Bunny. That scrap Positive Potato needed more than the little I had left, and only comes in 50g skeins. The Great A'Tuin demands a perfect green- and more than I originally ordered- alongside the smaller quantities of other shades for the shell. Searching through for the patterns to find uses has also meant finding ones that look amazing, but don't match my stash, given most are single skeins. Bit by bit, I've bought yarn to use yarn. Since starting this endeavour, I've added about half a kilo to my stash.

Projects are underway. The bunny just needs sewing up; Great A'Tuin is in progress; the recent purchases are in the soon-to-use bag. Hopefully, recent increase will result in a greater decrease once I get going. Hopefully. [](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1VxpiMcBXBPGMdDoSi63QK5ZRTgISf-6)
