There are so many fairy tales in existence, it is unlikely there is anyone in existence knows them all. Many will know the classics, ranging from the staples of European collectors like the Grimms and Perrault to the staples of the *Thousand and One Nights* anthologies. But there are some that rarely make it into retellings. This is a shame, as there are a multitude of incredible stories that deserve far more attention than they currently receive. So here are some fairy tales rarely discussed* in the United Kingdom.

**1. Diamonds and Toads**

A story by Charles Perrault. A widow with two daughters, each taking on the personality of a parent. Their opposing views cause matching responses from fairies seeking assistance. This contains many of the staples of classical fairy tales: an evil mother, a spoilt sister, a magical being that enacts karma, and a marriage that saves the good child from the terrible nature of her home life. But unlike a number of Perrault's other works, this one remains in relative obscurity.

**2. The Lady of the Elves**

Collected by Jon Arnason, an Icelandic scholar from the nineteenth century. A lonely beautiful woman barters for shelter in exchange for work. For three years, the young woman works on the farm, only skipping the Christmas mass. A farmhand decides to follow her to discover why, and finds out she is the queen of a fairyland. Upon managing to prove it to the frustrated farmwife, a curse is broken, and the beautiful young woman is able to return to her husband and child in her own kingdom.

**3. Gilitrutt**

Another Icelandic tale. The oddly dressed imp completing an impossible task is replaced with a crone offering to spin wool for a lazy farmer's wife. Both feature enigmatic payments and salvation through naming, suiting the concept of true names allowing power over an individual or being.

**4. The Sealskin**

Selkies are mythic water-dwellers capable of shedding their animal skin to become humans. The story appears in Irish, Scottish and Icelandic tales. A young man sees a group come onto land and steals one. When the rest return to the ocean, a sole woman remains crying on the beach. The man marries her, they have children, life goes on. Years later, the selkie finds her hidden skin and returns to the ocean, either unable or unwilling to return to her wedded family. Some versions have her throwing fish and treasure into her husband's ship to support them and apologise to the children she left behind.

**5. Little Brother and Little Sister**

This Grimm tale combines *Hansel and Gretel* with *Cinderella*. Two siblings escape an abusive stepmother by entering the forest, where they make a life despite the brother having been enchanted into becoming a fawn. The sister marries the King, has a child and life is good. The stepmother kills her, replaces her with her own daughter, and the ghost of the dead Queen returns to visit her brother and newborn. Upon discovering this, the King is able to return the ghost to corporeal form. The stepmother and daughter are killed, and with their deaths the enchantment on the fawn is broken and he becomes human again.

These five stories are enjoyable, and bear enough similarities to the standard canon that they will still likely appeal to the public. They also have a great deal of potential to be fleshed out and retold as a number of other fairy tales have been throughout history. How many of them did you already know? And which would you want to add to the list?
