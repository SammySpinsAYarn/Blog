When the film was released in 2009, *Coraline* was a colourful stop-motion animation that children were either enthralled or terrified by. As a single-digit-age person myself, I was fond of it, finding it a great little adventure akin to a creepier *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*, with equally ineffectual adults and games with far darker consequences. Now, over a decade later, I finally read the novel by Neil Gaiman, and must admit. It is both far creepier and far more confident than I would've thought.

[Tï»¿his YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2d1XYcMTDY&list=PLZqMA-B7h5X9Rwnfgvjkr-PZGE1YPdaGD&pp=iAQB) explores differences between the book and film, along with the videographer's theories. I saw this before listening to Gaiman's reading of his book. (Side note, the music in the edition I listened to reminded me of the ones in *The Series of Unfortunate Events* CDs I listened to at bedtimes.)
