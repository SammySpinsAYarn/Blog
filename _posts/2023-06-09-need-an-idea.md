When the film was released in 2009, *Coraline* was a colourful stop-motion animation that children were either enthralled or terrified by. As a single-digit-age person myself, I was fond of it, finding it a great little adventure akin to a creepier *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*, with equally ineffectual adults and games with far darker consequences. Now, over a decade later, I finally read the novel by Neil Gaiman, and must admit. It is both far creepier and far more confident than I would've thought.

[T﻿his YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2d1XYcMTDY&list=PLZqMA-B7h5X9Rwnfgvjkr-PZGE1YPdaGD&pp=iAQB) explores differences between the book and film, along with the videographer's theories. I saw this before listening to Gaiman's reading of his book. (Side note, the music in the Neil Gaiman edition reminded me of the songs in *The Series of Unfortunate Events* CDs.) The settings were more offputting, colours being used to unsettle rather than delight. Pink and green bedroom, and a smoke grey star covered jumper rather than one of vivid blue. The colour-change tunnel actually being dark and stretching and some sort of alive. The one exception is the door that starts this adventure. Rather than a small cupboard door in the wall, there is a huge one with a lock that clunks and creaks depending on the side. Every warning sign was covered in a lacquer of child-friendly colouring, enticing in the youthful audience much like the Other Mother's lures.

Y﻿et the narration gives a far greater sense of competence and confidence than the film elicits. Coraline is by no means unafraid, even crying at times. But she typically has a plan at the ready and thinks ahead for the best way to handle the dangerous situations she finds herself in. The book protagonist is more capable and prepared, collecting provisions and setting traps. Film Coraline is far more reactive, more reliant on those around her for assistance and protection, likely due to the exaggerated isolation the written representation experiences, having to fend for herself against the malevolent and far creepier Other Mother. This increased awareness is reassuring, as Coraline is more concious of the threat posed by the world on the other side of the door.
