K﻿nitting books are not new. They're in shops, libraries, archival collections, on bookshelves, and all over the internet. Most are tutorials and patterns, but there are numerous ones about the history of the craft and experiences of its practitioners. 

T﻿o round off, here are three recommendations of narrative non-fiction knitting books.

***Yarn Harlot* by Stephanie Pearl-McPhee** is a light-hearted first person look at the experiences of Pearl-McPhee, a Canadian doula who has been knitting since 1968. Her book follows struggling with works in progress, battling moths, and helping knitterly friends. Her storytelling is emotive and humourous, but covers grief tactfully and supportively. (TW for stillbirths.) Recommended for relatable first-person narrative from an experienced crafter.

***T﻿his Golden Fleece*** **by Esther Rutter** traces the history of knitting in the UK through twelve projects from across the British Isles and their roles on the local communities and economies. Rutter takes a more reflective historical tone as she analyses practical details and impacts.
