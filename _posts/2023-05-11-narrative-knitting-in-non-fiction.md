K﻿nitting books are not new. They're in shops, libraries, archival collections, on bookshelves, and all over the internet. Most are tutorials and patterns, but there are numerous ones about the history of the craft and experiences of its practitioners. For it is no coincidence that 'to spin a yarn' means to tell a story.

Y﻿arn craft is time consuming. Hours and hours with the quiet background sounds of equipment as fibre takes form. Before there was recorded music or radio, and crafters worked in shared spaces, they needed something to occupy the quiet and beat off the monotony of their tasks. So stories were swapped, gossip was shared, news was spread- talk filled the hours not consumed by other more active chores. Knitting was not always sedentary, but when it was, it could be prolonged. Entertainment was necessary, much like today. Sometimes the crafters worked themselves into their stories. (Rumplestiltskin's unusual spinning habits; the spinning wheel and spindle in Sleeping Beauty; Penelope's weaving in *The Odyssey*.) The stories helped fill the time and the quiet, and provided the mind escapism even as the body stayed put. Here readers gain connection through this mutual hobby. The yarn ties reader, writer, and creation, just as it does in patterns.

For those interested, here are three recommendations of narrative non-fiction knitting books.

*Yarn Harlot* by Stephanie Pearl-McPhee is a light-hearted first person look at the experiences of Pearl-McPhee, a Canadian doula who has been knitting since 1968. Her book follows struggling with works in progress, battling moths, and helping knitterly friends. Her storytelling is emotive and humourous, but covers grief tactfully and supportively. (TW for stillbirths.) Recommended for relatable first-person narrative from an experienced crafter.

*T﻿his Golden Fleece* by Esther Rutter traces the history of knitting in the UK through twelve projects from across the British Isles and their roles on the local communities and economies. Rutter takes a more reflective historical tone as she analyses practical details and impacts.

*A﻿ Stash Of One's Own* is an essay collection edited by contributor Clara Parkes that centres the relationships these crafters have with wool and yarn. It stays with them through loss and grief, and opens up enticing and exciting possibility, as well as approaches to consumerism and our relationship with material goods.

H﻿opefully at least one of these appeals to those wanting to read a little more about others knitting journeys.
