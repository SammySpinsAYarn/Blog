S﻿ide character, background character, non-player character. Names for the nameless. I enjoy writing, and worldbuilding, and last year joined a D&D campaign, so am becoming increasingly familiar with the joys of NPCs. So what is it about these 'fillers' that is so appealling, and why would I rather design one of those than a hero? 

F﻿irstly, they do not need the 'depth' we ascribe to major characters. Motivation, setting, role, and appearance are all they need to fulfill their role. You don't need an in-depth backstory, no detailed endeavour. It's like flash fiction character building. But you can add so much to a base-level being in a way that can really capture someone.

S﻿econdly, it is the variety. Are they a henchman with nothing beyond malevelonce and some level of grime? Are they a shop assistant ready with a smile? Are they a mercurial person with needed information and suspect intentions? Because they do not need to be long-term, there is more room for exploration across the wide array that can form from these.

T﻿hirdly, there is an element of roleplay that appeals. More and more people are aspiring to a more settled life rather than the grand escapades of heroes, be that due to financial, physical, or personal limitations and preferences. Side characters can be sort of gentle escapist roleplay, like the aesthetics online that allow the decorations of a different lifestyle without requiring a lifestyle change.
