S﻿ide character, background character, non-player character. Names for the nameless. I enjoy writing, and worldbuilding, and last year joined a D&D campaign, so am becoming increasingly familiar with the joys of NPCs. So what is it about these 'fillers' that is so appealling, and why would I rather design one of those than a hero? 

F﻿irstly, they do not need the 'depth' we ascribe to major characters. Motivation, setting, role, and appearance are all they need to fulfill their role. You don't need an in-depth backstory, no detailed endeavour. It's like flash fiction character building. But you can add so much to a base-level being in a way that can really capture someone.

S﻿econdly, it is the variety. Are they a henchman with nothing beyond malevelonce and some level of grime? Are they a shop assistant ready with a smile? Are they a mercurial person with needed information and suspect intentions?

T﻿hirdly, there is an element of roleplay different to that of my younger self.
