Monster of the week is an understandble concept. Each episode (as it is primarily a television concept) focuses on a different beast, with potential for something larger in the plot building up. Shows like *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, *The X-Files*, and *Grimm* are examples. But this also works for other media, and can be a simpler way of variable cohesion.
