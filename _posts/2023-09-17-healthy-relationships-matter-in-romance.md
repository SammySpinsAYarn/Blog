R﻿omance books are all about people coming together to form relationships. Otherwise, they aren't romance books. But regardless of what sub-genre you go in for, there needs to be more care in the labelling and tagging of these books as the storylines stray further from the cutesy, pure, and wholesome stories.

B﻿efore chaos ensues, this is by no means stating that twisted romances are wrong to exist. There will always be those attracted to darker romances in fiction just as they are in life. Rule 34 exists because all tastes exist and there are always those willing to cater to them (even when they shouldn't). But those need to labelled appropriately, and perhaps with disclaimers stating where to recieve help if elements of real relationships match those of the book. Just like people talk about the issues pornography is causing, or how dangerous the 'I can fix him' mentality is, there is more discourse on how the rose-tinted glasses approach to relationships ranging from unhealthy to abusive can create issues in the world beyond the pages. It is important to recognise this and label books that include these topics just as you would in other media.

R﻿omance is about the happily ever after element. Perhaps the beginning is tumultuous, with strangers coming together or lovers reaching a breaking point. But the point of most romances is an optimistic ending where the romantic partners have overcome obstacles and can be together. (There are exceptions, but this is the norm and deviations have been debated about whether those are truly romance books or if they fit better in another genre.)
