Unfortunately, books need space. It isn't possible to fit endless tomes on a bookcase, and leaving random stacks everywhere because of overflow is inviting danger. So, if you have limited shelf space, here are a few ways to make the most of your bookcase without warping a book or hiding any.

**S﻿ide Stacking**

T﻿his works best with books of the same size when the pile in question is taller than the spine's length. It capitalises on taller shelves and is the safer method of top stacking (resting a book on its cover on top of books shelved traditionally) to avoid the book on top getting bent by an uneven surface.

**S﻿taggered Double Shelving**

D﻿ouble stacking is often criticized for hiding the rear layer of books, but deeper shelves exist and no shelf space shold be wasted. The answer to to elevate the back books in some way, creating tiers of books. Egg boxes are the easiest method- three eggs deep is a great support for the 'standard' size paperback and lifts enough for the rear layer to be visible
