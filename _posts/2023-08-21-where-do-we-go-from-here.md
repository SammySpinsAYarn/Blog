Unfortunately, books need space. It isn't possible to fit endless tomes on a bookcase, and leaving random stacks everywhere because of overflow is inviting danger. So, if you have limited shelf space, here are a few ways to make the most of your bookcase without warping a book.

**S﻿ide Stacking**

T﻿his works best with books of the same size when the pile in question is taller than the spine's length. It capitalises on taller shelves and is the safer method of top stacking (resting a book on its cover on top of books shelved traditionally) to avoid the book on top getting bent by an uneven surface.

**S﻿taggered Double Shelving**

D﻿ouble stacking is often criticized for hiding the rear layer of books, but deeper shelves exist and no shelf space shold be wasted. The answer to to elevate the back books in some way, creating tiers of books. Egg boxes are the easiest method- three eggs deep is a great support for the 'standard' size paperback and lifts enough for the rear layer to be visible. (Be aware, hardbacks do not fit as neatly and this method works better if the back of the bookcase is all the same level. Warping is still possible if care is not taken.)

**Cover Out**

A﻿gain, this is to maximise space in deeper shelves. It also means beautiful cover art can be displayed rather than hidden. It uses the same principle as side stacking in being effective only if a stack is taller than the width of the book cover. This technique is used by bookshops who have a number of copies of the same book. It can also be used counteractively to make bookcases seem fuller by having a single book take up more width on shelf (extra books behind can be replaced by a small box to provide support).
