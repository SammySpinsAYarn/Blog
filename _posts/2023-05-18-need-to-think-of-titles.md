M﻿any have heard that the author is dead, and that you must separate art from artist. This is increasingly common as people are holding creators accountable and making sure to be more aware of bias within the work. So how do we consume material we enjoy by those whose views are problematic (or worse)? Simple. Don't mourn the author, kill them. (Note: this is a literaty metaphor, not a rallying cry to commit murder.)

D﻿eath of the author is a literary theory from literary critic Roland Barthes. He discusses the futility of authorship and the assignation of piece to creator, as intended meaning is lost once it leaves the custody of private ownership to enter public awareness. "Writing is...the negative where all identity is lost, starting with the very identity of the body writing." (Barthes, 1977, p142) He argues idolising the author as a genius is only relevant to critiques, and that the only true interpretation of a text is that which exists within readers. "The reader is the space
on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed without any of them being lost" (Barthes, 1977, p148), and the concept of authorial supremacy must be overthrown; "the birth of the reader must be at the cost of the death of the Author." (Barthes, 1977, p148). In summary, to write is to release control and connection to a work in the eyes of the public, and this is for the best because giving control over a text's meaning to the author is pointless to the majority of the audience.

According to Barthes, the author is dead; they killed their own voice by disseminating their work beyond where they themselves could present it. But even so, public conception of an author holds them as The Authority on their work. Canon is held in high esteem (generally) as it is the original text that appealled to consumers enough for the spinoffs, headcanons, and fan works, to be produced.
