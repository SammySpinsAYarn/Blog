M﻿any have heard that the author is dead, and that you must separate art from artist. This is increasingly common as people are holding creators accountable and making sure to be more aware of bias within the work. So how do we consume material we enjoy by those whose views are problematic (or worse)? Simple. Don't mourn the dauthor, kill them. (Note: this is a literaty metaphor, not a rallying cry to commit murder.)

D﻿eath of the author is a literary theory from literary critic Roland Barthes. He discusses how in previous centuries, stories were shared as a result of oral tradition and the method of dissemination.
