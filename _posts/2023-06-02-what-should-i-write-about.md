T﻿here is nothing in this world that lacks its gatekeepers, and sadly books is not the exception. Genre and format tend to be the most debated, and there is no more maligned book format than the audiobook. Many say that because it is a verbal rather than written telling, it should not be defined as reading. They are wrong.

T﻿o read something is "to understand and give a particular meaning to written information, a statement, a situation, etc." (according to [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/read)). This is why Braille is still considered reading, even when it does not include the visual element of traditional printed reading.
