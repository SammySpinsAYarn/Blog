T﻿here is nothing in this world that lacks its gatekeepers, and sadly books are not the exception. Genre and format tend to be the most debated, and there is no more maligned book format than the audiobook. Many say that because it is a verbal rather than written telling, it should not be defined as reading. They are wrong.

T﻿o read something is often thought to mean looking at a piece of text and decipher squiggles to understand meaning. And it can be. Indeed, if it were the only definition, audiobooks would not be a type of reading. But it isn't. Reading can also mean "to understand and give a particular meaning to written information, a statement, a situation, etc." (according to [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/read)). This is why Braille is still considered reading, even when it does not include the visual element of traditional printed reading. And it is why stories can be read without the involvement of eyes.

W﻿riting is not new. The [first evidence of texts](https://www.bl.uk/history-of-writing/articles/where-did-writing-begin) is in Iraq, known then as Mesopotamia, circa 3400BC, through pictographic representation, which later evolved into characters. But speech has been posited to have existed for [at least 200,000 years](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/12/when-did-ancient-humans-start-speak/603484/). To suggest that storytelling does not pre-exist writing is to say that no one told a story for over 195,000 years. More likely is that the stories written, like the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, were adapted to the new technology just as fairy tales are transferred to new media today. Oral storytelling is far older than writing, with the original 'audiobook' being a live telling, just as how plays were the original films. This means, if anything, audiobooks are more traditional way of reading a story than a written text. Those relying on the history of books sorely misunderstand the far longer and more varied legacy of storytelling.

W﻿hen it comes to media, it is the story that is the most important element. This is why classical stories have spread across to all manner of technologies and methods of presentation, from the classical book to video games to apps and far more. This is how people can read meaning in, or analyse, all kinds of things without having to look at writing to decipher what has transpired. It's how you can read the room, or read between the lines. Reading is about the story you're absorbing and understanding, not the way you do it.

T﻿here is no reason to say that audiobooks are not reading. Next time someone tries this argument, remind them that reading has more than one definition. And ask why the medium is more important to them than the message.
