Yarn crafters are familiar with the stash effect. The unwitting accumulation and seemingly independent multiplication of craft supplies. How individual skeins seem manageable but gather into hoards and lurk, waiting to topple out of storage spaces and bury the unsuspecting. My stash is smaller than others I've heard about, but still feels large. Somehow, in my efforts to shrink it through use, I have gathered more..

Iï»¿t started out simply enough. I decided I wanted to fit my stash into the new project bag I'd bought, which seems a good size and has fancy storage to fit all the needles, hooks, and associated habadashery. Accompanying this is a big supermarket shopping bag and smaller ongoing project bag, also full. These three bags contain the stash, all six-and-a-half-kilograms or so. (Yes, compared to others, this isn't huge. Still too big for my tastes.)
