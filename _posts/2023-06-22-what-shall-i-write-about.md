Yarn crafters are familiar with the stash effect. The unwitting accumulation and seemingly independent multiplication of craft supplies. How individual skeins seem manageable but gather into hoards and lurk, waiting to topple out of storage spaces and bury the unsuspecting. My stash is smaller than others I've heard about, but still feels large. Somehow, in my efforts to shrink it through use, I have gathered more.
