Mï»¿aking something is inherently a task with purpose. When you knit or sew or crochet or bake or sculpt, you are producing something; there is a goal, an end result. Sometimes, however, it feels like because you are shaping something that the something in question must be functional to justify the time and money put into it. This is not the case.
