M﻿aking something is inherently a task with purpose. When you knit or sew or crochet or bake or sculpt, you are producing something; there is a goal, an end result. Sometimes, however, it feels like because you are shaping something that the something in question must be functional to justify the time and money put into it. This is not the case.

M﻿ost of my craft projects have been toys. I make amigurumi animals because its fun and they're cool. However, I learnt to knit and crochet to support emergency staff. My first proper thing was a knitted breast I made for a student midwife for lactation consulations. I learnt to crochet to make for the [Octopus for a Preemie UK](https://octopusforapreemie.co.uk/) charity. I've researched [Bobby Buddies](https://www.hampshire.police.uk/news/hampshire/news/news/2019/september/bobby-buddies-officers-give-teddy-bears-to-children-living-with-domestic-abuse/#:~:text=...%20Knitted%20police%20officer%20teddy%20bears%20are%20being,exist%20when%20police%20attend%20after%20a%20domestic%20incident.) and Innocent smoothie hats and [twiddle muffs](https://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/documents/twiddle-muffs.pdf). But despite this, all my other projects have been fun bits of nonsense for friends and family. Animals and characters to sit on shelves and bring a smile, and that is ok.

H﻿istorically, crafting was about survival or flaunting. For the less economically stable, it was an income source and a cheaper way of making clothes and goods for yourself and the family. For the wealthy, it was proving your skill at a craft the same way accomplished musicians do.
