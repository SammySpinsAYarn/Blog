Occasionally a term will arise when children’s literature comes up in the news. There’ll be a quote from a well-known name attached to the term ‘children’s laureate’, who will be espousing the importance of literacy and reading among young people. But why is this person talking about it, and why should we care?

The idea for a children’s laureate came about in 1999, when Ted Hughes, then Poet Laureate, and Michael Morpurgo, popular children’s author, came up with the idea. Its purpose is to recognise those making an impact in children’s literature and use them as a platform to further promote the importance of getting all children, regardless of ability or demographic, to read. The inaugural laureate was illustrator Quentin Blake, and has since been a title awarded to Cressida Cowell, Malorie Blackman, Chris Riddell, and now Joseph Coehlo.
