Occasionally a term will arise when children’s literature comes up in the news. There’ll be a quote from a well-known name attached to the term ‘children’s laureate’, who will be espousing the importance of literacy and reading among young people. But why is this person talking about it, and why should we care?

The idea for a children’s laureate came about in 1999, when Ted Hughes, then Poet Laureate, and Michael Morpurgo, popular children’s author, came up with the idea. Its purpose is to recognise those making an impact in children’s literature and use them as a platform to further promote the importance of getting all children, regardless of ability or demographic, to read. The inaugural laureate was illustrator Quentin Blake, and has since been a title awarded to others, including Cressida Cowell, Malorie Blackman, Chris Riddell, and now Joseph Coehlo.

A﻿lthough a private endeavour sponsored by Waterstones and an assortment of literacy charities, the impact of these individuals matters. They connect with children through their stories and their work, providing entertainment and encouraging reading- something that has become more difficult in recent years. The past two have paid special attention to the value of libraries in children's lives, with Cowell campaigning for funding in primary school libraries and Coehlo promoting the public library system by cycling to all of them and signing up for them. But why does this matter?

B﻿ecause it is positive interaction with literacture and books and facilities. The Children's Laureate is an approachable and recognisable face for children to use as an almost parasocial relationship as a bridge to books and reading at a higher level. Laureateship is awarded to "[combine the celebration of excellence in writing and illustration for children with honouring individuals who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the world of children’s books](https://www.booktrust.org.uk/what-we-do/childrens-laureate/about-the-laureate/)", meaning the names and faces are recognisable to children. Mainstream writers help children recognise the value of the things these writers/illustrators are promoting by capitalising on their existing connection to them.
