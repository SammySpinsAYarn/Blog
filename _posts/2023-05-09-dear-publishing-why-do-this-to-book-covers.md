D﻿ear Publishing Industry, I﻿ think you're great. You help form books and share stories and spread knowledge and record histories and all sorts of fabulous things. But I have a few questions and gripes about your cover design choices, and I think readers deserve answers.

F﻿or context, I have a degree that explored the publishing industry and featured considerations like marketing, typography and cover designer, and the trade publishing market. I know that there is 'logic' to most of the decisions made on the books. I know each book is an investment carefully considered and crafted to maximise its sales. I know that sometimes the best decision is not the popular decision. But even with all this in mind, there are certain things that frustrate me, and I will propose alternatives to each here.

F﻿irst of all, the ultimate sin of cover design: the irremovable sticker. There is a certain appeal, a level of bragging involved in these. Often they are about an accomplishment by the book or author, such as an adaptation or an award. Fabulous, well done! Congratulations to all involved in getting the book to this point! Why does this require the maiming of the book? There are far more attractive, less intrusive methods of display; banners at the top, or actual stickers on it, or even a comment on a less obtrusive part of the book (inside or on the back cover, for example). Advertising stickers should not be placed in the same manner as actual stickers, defacing otherwise beautiful covers or mangle editions after the initial release. If it will forever be a part of the book, it needs the same consideration other parts of cover design do rather than the way you'd place an actual sticker.

T﻿hen we have the weird second-cover-flap. What even is that? Why is it there? A design feature for interest? An extra element like French flaps?
