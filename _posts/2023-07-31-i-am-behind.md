A﻿s with anything, the price point of yarn crafts can vary hugely. Yarns varying from under a pound to over twenty; hooks and needles cheaper than chips or as expensive as big night out; assorted accessories and tools adding up to exorbitant amounts. While some talk about how pricey it can be, there are easy basic ways to start off cheaply.

T﻿he first option is to lower your standards for materials. People talking about how expensive it is are spending lots on high quality stuff that beginners do not yet need. In most cases a second hand pair of needles or set of hooks from a local charity shop of from eBay (or equivalent) will do fine to begin with. Bargain balls of yarn are fine for early projects where it's more important to get the stich right consistently than to demonstrate total mastery of fibre art. 

T﻿his is not to say that spending more won't make a difference. A different fibre type may be necessary if the project has a particular purpose or if the recipient has texture sensitivities. Experimenting with different needles and hooks may make it more pleasant or accessible. But to test if the activity is appealling, you do not have to spend huge quantities from the offset for what is essentially an experiment.

P﻿atterns are another money drain crafters complain about. There are three main methods of reducing price: buying books, the library, and using free ones. Most yarn companies have lots of free patterns online. They may be on their own website, available through online yarn retailers, or on platforms like Ravelry, YouTube, and blogs. Indie designers often have free web editions of their patterns alongside their ad-free for-purchase PDFs and EPUBs. Libraries often have subscriptions for magazines
