A﻿s with anything, the price point of yarn crafts can vary hugely. Yarns varying from under a pound to over twenty; hooks and needles cheaper than chips or as expensive as big night out; assorted accessories and tools adding up to exorbitant amounts. While some talk about how pricey it can be, there are easy basic ways to start off cheaply.

T﻿he first option is to lower your standards. People talking about how expensive it is are spending lots on high quality stuff that beginners do not yet need. In most cases a second hand pair of needles or set of hooks from a local charity shop of from eBay (or equivalent) will do fine to begin with. Bargain balls of yarn are fine for early projects where it's more important to get the stich right consistently than to demonstrate total mastery of fibre art.
