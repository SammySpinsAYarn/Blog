Helvetica is the (in)famous Swiss type created in 1957. Since its making, it has been upheld as the perfect type, discarded as a capitalist scam, and used so often in today's writing that it has become almost invisible in its ubiquity. So what is Helvetica, and why is it either controversial or unnoticed?

Helvetica is a light sans-serif typeface with no contrast that sits in the mid-ground of typographic voice with neutrality being its main feature. The designers were Miedinger and Hoffman, typographers in a small company under the umbrellas of industry giants. It was inspired by the waves of minimalist influence in post-war Europe and the desire for a new typeface without the frills and pretension of historic and established prints.

This new typeface enthralled the public. It was untainted by the undertones of established or more stylised texts. It was new and fresh and toneless. Helvetica's simplicity meant it could be (and was) used in indiscriminately across any number of platforms and by a huge variety of businesses. It quickly became a staple font in daily life.

So why did this marvel of a font begin to engender such vigorous distaste within the typographic community? For the very same reason it is invisible to the general public- its ubiquity.

Helvetica began to shift in the mind of certain generations as a symbol of authoritarianism. Its blank shapes and lack of personality meant it was without the personality and individuality that the audience sought. They also associated it with the large conglomerates and businesses that were unpopular due to being symbolic of what was considered an oppressive state and culture/society. Typographers began to yearn for more tailored, specialised fonts with greater focus; they sought to rise above the tide of generic that is Helvetica's omnipresence by prioritising focused types. This distaste in the industry continues.

So like Marmite, Helvetica has two audiences in those who are truly aware of it (rather than the blankness of the general populace who do not recognise Helvetica as a typeface). Those who love it for its simplicity, neutrality and prevalence. And those who despise for those same reasons.
