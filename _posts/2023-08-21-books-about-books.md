Books are written on all topics, so it should suprise no one that there are both fiction and non-fiction books out in the world about these artefacts and the people involed in their production. How-tos on their writing and production, analyses on their history and role in the world, to current books all about those whose lives centre the books. Here are a few I want to read in the newar future.



##### [T﻿he Cat Who Saved Books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/19a53404-887d-4bde-b209-60fb17679d2c) by Sōsuke Natsukawa and [What You Are Looking For is in the Library](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2409ddb7-9114-42fd-86c4-39996c61befc) by Michiko Aoyama

B﻿oth of these books are translated Japanese fiction books centring bookish locations and a fantastical element. In the first a talking cat enlists a teenager, who inherited their recently deceased grandfather's bookshop, in a mission to save unloved books. It is apparently a hopeful and reflective novel, and at under 200 pages sounds like a whimsical weekend read. The latter follows a magical librarian who helps her patrons through book recommendations capable of altering their life's path, and she (presumably) gets a front row seat to this upon the book's return. A light-hearted literary wander among a library's shelves alongside someone capable of mystical book suggestions? No part of that is unappealling.



##### [T﻿he Bookseller at the End of the World](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fdd9a6ca-8508-4f7e-8b7a-3212e77fa61f) by Ruth Shaw and [The Diary of a Bookseller](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a0545a9c-cd38-4f6b-b3fd-d55c8bbe62c9) by Shaun Bythell

T﻿hese memoirs follow booksellers; Bythell making witty observations in his second-hand bookshop in Scotland, Shaw operating in New Zealand interspersed with her wild adventures. Both are a little over 300 pages and reflect on the sellers and their customers. I anticipate a number of interesting stories



##### [Burning the Books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cf893705-ae12-4bf2-97d3-c3c5d1a76ccb) by Richard Ovenden and [The Dictionary People](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fc13b2a0-bbb6-487c-977a-7d6f5294c38c) by Sarah Ogilvie

O﻿venden, director of Oxford's Bodleian explores the history of pyro-censorship by exploring the long history of book burnings. A librarian exploring the systematic destruction of their work throughout the ages and its causes sounds suitably intellectual and interesting, and offers a more academic alternative to *Ink and Bone*, where the protagonist cannot understand why people destroy books. Ogilvie goes for a combination of etymology and sociology, exploring the cooperative nature of the shaping of the dictionary and thereby language at large. These two non-fiction texts provide a studied approach to books as a subject of study and how their role is influenced by and influences wider history.



S﻿o those are the six books about books that have snuck their way onto my TBR. Perhaps some appealled to you and will now make their way onto your shelves or pile of library loans. And if not, there are far more out there than you might originally expect. One quick search is all it would take to find some that would.
