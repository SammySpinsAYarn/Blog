T﻿rigger warnings are not new- they apparently began in the 1970s as a way to protect victims of sexual assault. But nowadays, they are considered controversial, either a welcome note to prepare, or pandering and patronising. They are seen as another way modern life is over-senstitive and unable to cope. However, it is more that they are adaptive as there is greater public awareness of the consequences media depictions can have. Just as support has (allegedly) improved, so to have the accommodations made for those who need them. Trigger warnings play a part in this.

C﻿ontent warnings are not new. They have existed for many decades. The Hays Code was succeeded by age ratings, which continue now, giving a set of guides regarding content so those unprepared for it can avoid it. The Comics Code Authority limited what was allowed in comic books and graphic books published with their approval. These were accepted ways for mediums to avoid government intervention, but also to preserve their creditibility to the public. Admittedly, they also used controversial morality to decide what was permissible, and this continues to gatekeep media in harmful ways for minority groups. But the point remains that labelling content as 'inappropriate for reasons' is not new. Trigger warnings is simply a less restrictive progression.

﻿*This \[insert medium] includes reference to/depiction of \[insert problematic occurence], consumer discretion is advised. Relevant is assistance is available from \[insert resource/organisation here].* This is all a trigger warning need include. No 'do not consume this if' or 'those under a certain age should not read'. It is not a means of censorship to meant to prevent media consumption. It is a content warning meant to allow those interested a better understanding of what that thing entails, be it a film, book, album, etc. Like a more targeted blurb meant to prevent bad reviews and angry rants online, just like a trope list or tag, but with more meaning.

T﻿he little messages are also a disclaimer of sorts. By placing a warning, just as films do for epilepsy triggers, companies are also better protected from liability and are assisting customer satisfaction by providing a more comprehensive idea of what a piece of content contains and entails.
