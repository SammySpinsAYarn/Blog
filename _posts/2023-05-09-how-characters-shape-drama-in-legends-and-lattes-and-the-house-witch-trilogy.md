S﻿takes are key in stories. They must feel important, and mean something to the character to ensure the reader understands and/or supports their actions. Stakes are variable, from a child getting away with a prank to the salvation of a universe. But the drama within these texts also differs, changing the tension readers feel. This contrast is clear in the differences between Delemhach's *The House Witch* trilogy and Travis Baldree's *Legends & Lattes*. 

*T﻿he House Witch* follows Finn, a witch whose magic focuses on domestic tasks as he enters the castle to become the cook as the country sits on the cusp of war. Even as international politics worsen and the war becomes inevitable, Finn's main concerns are looking after the royal children, wooing the widowed Viscountess Jenoure, and feeding the castle residents- despite his growing responsibilities and part in the defense of the kingdom.

M﻿eanwhile, *Legends and Lattes* centres retired advernturer Viv as she starts her new coffee shop in a town where no one even knows what that is. Her focus is on putting violent adventuring behind her while hiding a secret she credits with good fortune and handling the local mob. As Viv's circle grows and friendships grower closer and deeper, Viv remains ever concious of the threats lingering just outside her doors.
