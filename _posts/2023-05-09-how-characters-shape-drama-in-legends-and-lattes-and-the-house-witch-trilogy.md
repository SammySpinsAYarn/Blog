S﻿takes are key in stories. They must feel important, and mean something to the character to ensure the reader understands and/or supports their actions. Stakes are variable, from a child getting away with a prank to the salvation of a universe. But the drama within these texts also differs, changing the tension readers feel. This contrast is clear in the differences between Delemhach's *The House Witch* trilogy and Travis Baldree's *Legends & Lattes*. 

*T﻿he House Witch* follows Finn, a witch with domestic magic as he becomes castle cook in a country sitting on the cusp of war. Even as conflict becomes inevitable, Finn's main concerns are looking after the royalty, wooing widowed Viscountess Jenoure, and feeding castle residents- despite his growing responsibilities and noble connections.

M﻿eanwhile, *Legends and Lattes* centres retired advernturer Viv as she opens a coffee shop in a town where no one knows what coffee is. She focuses ion putting violent adventuring behind her, while hiding a secret lucky charm, and handling the local mob. As Viv's circle grows and friendships grower closer and deeper, Viv remains ever concious of the threats lingering just outside her doors.

T﻿he two characters are both in unfamiliar settings meeting new people and dealing with dangerous threats to their new homes while testing the waters on a romantisc relationship; yet the character outlooks completely change the story. Drama in *The House Witch* feels less intense despite its greater stakes because Finn's attention is more centred on the domesticity of his role as cook. In constrast, despite Viv's entrepreneurial endavours, the threat remains at the forefront of her mind as the plot progresses. The high drama, low stakes setting of Viv's story opposes the low drama, high stakes story of Finn's adventure.
