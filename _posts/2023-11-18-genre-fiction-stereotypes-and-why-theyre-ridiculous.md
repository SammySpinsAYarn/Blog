E﻿veryone has heard these stereotypes, especially if they're a reader. Having a favourite genre apparently says more than just what storylines you enjoy; it reveals somthing about you as a person. But that is ridiculous, especially as genres continue to intersect and bleed together in media.

**C﻿rime and thriller is for creepy people.**

N﻿o. Enjoying storylines involving crime and death is not new, nor does it mean anything depraved about you. Penny dreadfuls were one of the first widely distributed means of storytelling, and captivated the public's attention. Stories of serial killers, gruesome deaths, and scandalous or impossible crime appear in almost every storytelling medium to huge popular interest. There are fields of study regarding the psychology of those who inspire these plotlines or cause these news articles. Enjoying a fictionilisation of this where the perpetrator is typically caught and punished is almost a means of carthases rather than some perverse fascination.

**Science fiction and fantasy is for nerds.**

T﻿hese are the genres that have arguably gone the most mainstream in recent years. *Marvel, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, The Witcher*. The list can go on. Escapist storytelling is on the rise. Who could possibly guess why...? Sure, there are still levels of interest, but encyclopedic knowledge of anything is odd, not just fictional content.

**L﻿iterary and classical fiction are snobbish.**

Arguably the most accessible and widely available story genres. Classics are cheaper to publish, and often are recognisable to the public as they have read them or at least have heard of them due to their long histories. Literary fiction meanwhile gets the biggest literary awards and may well have the more relatable stories than many other genres, if more dramatic (but that can be said of any genre). These stories are often about more realistic people, making them easier for readers to enter without needing to absorb new knowledge.

**N﻿on-fiction is boring.**

I﻿f you think this, you are clearly a boring person. Non-fiction just means made up, and contains an incredible range of topics. Cookbooks and DIY manuals? Non-fiction. Biographies, autobiographies, and history books (including *Horrible Histories*)? Non-fiction. Anything on the wider world, from nature books to travelbooks to any political or social exploration? Non-fiction. If you have never voluntarily read a fiction book, you have never been curious about an element of real life, and that is very sad for you.

**A﻿lternative mediums don't count as reading.**

A﻿s previously discussed, audiobooks are real books, so still count as 'reading'. Comic books, graphic novels, and picture books are also still reading. They are the visual interpretation of a series of shapes to understand a progressing story. That is is reading.

**R﻿omance books are only for lonely, unhappy women, and create unrealistic expectations.**

W﻿ow, ok cynic. First off, romance books are for anyone who enjoys hearing about another's relationship. And a fair amount of time, romance books either have or are secondary storylines to add to those characters as individuals with lives beyond the love interest- as everyone should. And for unrealistic expectations, most people have those anyway. People call it settling for a reason. Now though, those expectations are higher because independence has allowed women to have higher self-worth and want a romanitc *partner* rather than just wanting to be with someone.

**Y﻿A is for teenage girls.**

Y﻿A just means young adult, or teen. It is a genre that has created a number of hugely popular authors and series, and can cover some incredibly important and sensitive topics. People often undervalue the importance of the literature given to those whose minds and worldview are still being formed. Besides, even if it were only for teenage girls, why would that mean it has any less value than books written just for adult men?

**R﻿eading is solitary hobby and doing it makes you an intellectual.**

S﻿ocial media has proven what book clubs already knew- reading does not have to be a solitary hobby. Fandom is a real and powerful force that can make a huge difference in people's lives and friendships. While it can be done alone, it does not *have* to be. And because a book can be on any topic, reading does not, unfortunately, make you an intellectual. It can improve vocabulary and language skills, yes, but reading nothing but boy band fan fics will not make you a scholar.
