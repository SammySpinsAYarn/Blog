E﻿veryone has heard these stereotypes, especially if they're a reader. Having a favourite genre apparently says more than just what storylines you enjoy; it reveals somthing about you as a person. But that is ridiculous, especially as genres continue to intersect and bleed together in media.

**C﻿rime and thriller is for creepy people.**

N﻿o. Enjoying storylines involving crime and death is not new, nor does it mean anything depraved about you. Penny dreadfuls were one of the first widely distributed means of storytelling, and captivated the public's attention. Stories of serial killers, gruesome deaths, and scandalous or impossible crime appear in almost every storytelling medium to huge popularity. There are fields of study regarding the psychology of those who inspire these plotlines or cause these news articles. Enjoying a fictionilisation of this where the perpetrator is typically caught and punished is almost a means carthases rather than some perverse fascination.
